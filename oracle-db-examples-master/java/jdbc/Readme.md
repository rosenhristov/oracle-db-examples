# JDBC based examples  
The Oracle JDBC drivers allow Java applications to connect and process data in the Oracle Database. These are fully compliant with the latest JDBC specifications which defines the standard `java.sql` interfaces. 

**Type 4 and type 2 drivers** The Oracle database furnishes a type 4 driver a.k.a. JDBC-Thin and a type 2 driver a.k.a. JDBC-OCI however, JDBC-Thin  is the most used and recommended driver type. Java applications simply need to have **ojdbc8.jar** (for JDK/JRE 8) in their classpath. 

**Cloud Database Services** The JDBC Thin driver allows connecting to the various Oracle Database Cloud Services including: the Oracle Database Service **(DBCS)**, the Oracle Exadata Express Cloud Service **(EECS)**, and the Oracle Database Service on Bare Metal **(BMCS)**.  Please refer to [JDBC and Oracle Database Service on Cloud](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/application-development/jdbc/documentation/index.html) for detailed instructions. 

**Prerequisite - JDBC Tutorial** The examples in this folder assume a basic knowledge of JDBC [See the JDBC Java Tutorial]( https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/index.html)
